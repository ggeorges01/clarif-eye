      <h1>About Clarif-Eye</h1>
      <p>
        The Clarif-Eye App was created to be the trusted companion for the visually impaired or blind individuals.
        Specifically, Clarif-Eye was designed to help individuals who are legally blind to reclaim their independence, and live free from the 
        constant companionship of their loved ones, or an eye-seeing dog.
